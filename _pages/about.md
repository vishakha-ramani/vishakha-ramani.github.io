# About Me

Hi! I'm Vishakha (she/her; pronounced "Vi-sha-kha"), currently a Research Scientist at IBM Thomas J Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights.

In October 2024, I completed my PhD in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at Rutgers University, where I was advised by [Prof. Roy D. Yates](https://www.winlab.rutgers.edu/~ryates/).

My research interests broadly cover the performance modeling and analysis of real-time systems through queueing theory, scheduling, and stochastic processes. My [PhD thesis](http://vishakha-ramani.github.io/files/Thesis_VR.pdf) particularly focused on analyzing and optimizing Age of Information (AoI) in shared memory systems.

More to come soon!
